# Canyon Racer

A Top Down Racing Game for the Game Boy built around a Vertical Parallax effect.

This project started just wanting to try a vertical parallax effect on the original Game Boy (DMG), as seen in the "[Demotronic](https://demozoo.org/productions/20662/)" demo by [1.000.000 Boys](https://demozoo.org/productions/20662/). Then it grew some horizontal sine waves and eventually mutated into a small game demo.
